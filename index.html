            <div class="release-date">This map was released in September 2020. To see the latest iteration and analysis check out the <a href="https://www.jainfamilyinstitute.org/projects/millennial-student-debt/">JFI Millennial Student Debt project page</a>. This project is a winner of Princeton University's 2020 Dignity + Debt <a href="https://www.dignityanddebt.org/projects/student-debt-contest/">Visualizing Student Debt Contest</a>. Updated February 2021 with <a href="./comparison">the comparisons page</a>.</div>
            <p>Student loan debt now stands at over $1.6 trillion according to <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/current/">estimates</a> released this month by the Federal Reserve, a 75% increase from 10 years ago. Since the Great Recession, both average balances and the number of borrowers have consistently increased across the board. As more borrowers accumulate more debt, they increasingly cannot pay it off. Student debt balances have the character of filling a bathtub in which the drain is blocked.</p>
            <p>This map and its <a href="https://phenomenalworld.org/analysis/millenial-student-debt">accompanying in-depth analysis</a> focus on the age group that is suffering the most from the student debt crisis—young adults aged 18–35. By examining the interaction between student loan balances, geography, income, and tuition, we seek to demystify the crisis and the year-over-year trends post-recession to 2019.

            <h1>About Our Sources</h1>
            <p>This analysis uses school-reported Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (<span class="smallcaps">IPEDS</span>) data from the final releases for the academic year of 2020–2021 and from the provisional release for the academic year 2021–2022. For median income and population estimates, we used data from the 5-year American Community Survey (2016–2020). For young-adult student debt balances, we used Experian’s consumer credit archives. Median income, school prices, and debt values were adjusted to 2022 dollars using the Federal Reserve Consumer Price Index (all items) data.</p>

            <h1>Methodology</h1>
            <p>Variables derived for each geographical area:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Number of Schools</b> - The number of schools displayed for each state/county/zip is a tally of the schools within the geographical area.
                </li>
                <b>Enrollment</b> - The enrollment displayed for each state/county/zip is the summation of the enrollment for every school within the geographical area. The Enrollment variable takes a whole number and is sourced from <span class="smallcaps">IPEDS</span> 12-Month Enrollment Table. This value indicates how many unduplicated undergraduate individuals enrolled for credit the institution served over a 12 month period, regardless of when the individual enrolled.
                    <p>$$ \text{Enrollment}_{\text{area}} = \text{enrollment}_1 + \text{enrollment}_2 + \dots + \text{enrollment}_n $$</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Average Net Price</b> - Average Net Price is the average total cost of attending minus the average amount of federal, state or local government, or institutional grant and scholarship aid. Total cost of attendance is the sum of tuition, required fees, books and supplies, and the weighted average of room and board and other expenses. The value displayed for each state/county/zip is the mean of the average net price of all schools within the geographical area, weighted by the enrollment number of each school. The average net price per school is the average of the following variables sourced from <span class="smallcaps">IPEDS</span>: <em>NPIS412, NPIS422, NPIS432, NPIS442, NPIS452, NPT412, NPT422, NPT432, NPT442, NPT452</em>. These variables from <span class="smallcaps">IPEDS</span> show the average price of attendance for full-time, first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates paying the in-state or in-district tuition rate who were awarded title <span class="smallcaps">IV</span> federal student aid by varying degrees of student income level. All average net price values have been adjusted for inflation using the consumer price index (<span class="smallcaps">CPI</span>) deflator and are in 2022 <span class="smallcaps">US</span> dollars.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Average Tuition and Fees</b> - Average Tuition and Fees is the mean published tuition and fees of all schools within each state/county/zip, weighted by the enrollment number of each school. This is derived from each school’s published tuition and fees, for the given academic year, for academic year reporters only. Price of attendance for full-time, first-time undergraduate students for the <span class="smallcaps">FULL ACADEMIC YEAR</span>: (Tuition and fees are those amounts used by your financial aid office for determining eligibility for student financial assistance) These data are published at the <span class="smallcaps">IPEDS</span> College Navigator Website.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Clear-cut variables per state/county/zip:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Institution Name</b> - These names are sourced from the <span class="smallcaps">IPEDS</span> Institutional Characteristics table. It represents the Institution or Entity Name.</li>
                <li><b>Map Name</b> - The institution name plus the name of the campus / branch of that institution. The <em>Map Name</em> will equal <em>Institution Name</em> if the institution has only one campus / branch. </li>
                <li><b>Level of Institution</b> - Level of Institutions are sourced from the <span class="smallcaps">IPEDS</span> Institutional Characteristics table. A classification of whether an institution’s programs are 4-year or higher (4 year aka <em>Bachelors</em>), 2-but-less-than 4-year (2 year aka <em>Associates</em>), or less than 2-years (aka <em>Below Associate</em>).</li>
                <li><b>Control of Institution</b> - Control of Institutions and definitions are sourced from the <span class="smallcaps">IPEDS</span> Institutional Characteristics table. A classification of whether an institution is operated by publicly elected or appointed officials or by privately elected or appointed officials and derives its major source of funds from private sources.
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>Public institution</em> - An educational institution whose programs and activities are operated by publicly elected or appointed school officials and which is supported primarily by public funds.</li>
                        <li><em>Private not-for-profit institution</em> - A private institution in which the individual(s) or agency in control receives no compensation, other than wages, rent, or other expenses for the assumption of risk. These include both independent not-for-profit schools and those affiliated with a religious organization.</li>
                        <li><em>Private for-profit institution</em> - A private institution in which the individual(s) or agency in control receives compensation other than wages, rent, or other expenses for the assumption of risk.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>Average / Median Total Balance for Student Loan Borrowers aged 18–35</b> - This estimate represents the state/county/zip median balance on total (deferred plus non-deferred) student loan debt in 2022, conditional on an individual being aged 18-35 and having a positive non-zero student loan balance.
                    <ul>
                        <li>The estimate is sourced from a cross-sectional credit archive sample by Experian Information Solutions of one million 18–35 year olds with recent student loan activity randomly selected at the end of June. A county or zip with missing data indicates there were not enough sampled individuals to create an estimate.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>Average / Median Income for Student Loan Borrowers aged 18–35</b> - This represents the state/county/zip average/median estimated total income in 2022, conditional on an individual being 18–35 years of age and having a non-zero student debt loan balance.
                    <ul>
                        <li>The estimate is sourced from a cross-sectional credit archive sample by Experian Information Solutions of one million 18–35 year olds with recent student loan activity randomly selected at the end of June. A county or zip with missing data indicates there were not enough sampled individuals to create an estimate.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Variables by race:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Because we don’t directly observe race in the credit reporting data, we analyze it at the census tract level by using the individual’s provided census tracts to link the data with the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey 5-year estimates (2016–2020). Individuals are sorted into racial categories based on the racial plurality of the sampled individual’s census tract.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Exclusion Criteria:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We excluded schools that offered exclusively advanced degrees, exclusively distance learning degrees, and schools where <em>level</em> and <em>control</em> of institution were unknown. Also excluded were administrative offices of institutions when the institution itself was counted separately, as located. If a school offered a bachelors or higher degree but no degree below bachelors, the graduate to undergraduate student ratio was over 10, and the undergraduate enrollment was below 100, the school was excluded. For public schools, driving distances were restricted to the state where the school resides.</li>
                <li>In regards to branch campuses: <span class="smallcaps">IPEDS</span> does not require institutions to report data separately for branch campuses. We parsed through websites of over 400 colleges with high likelihoods of having branch campuses. If you suspect an error on our map or missing data, please do not hesitate to <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc8zKxb1WiHkEMcljk701caviug0tzb2kE0hTO1YGpV4NSpHw/viewform">contact us</a>. More on how <span class="smallcaps">IPEDS</span> data is reported: According to the <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/statprog/handbook/pdf/ipeds.pdf">IPEDS handbook</a>,
                    <blockquote><em>All institutions in the <span class="smallcaps">U.S.</span> and other <span class="smallcaps">U.S.</span> jurisdictions that have a Program Participation Agreement (<span class="smallcaps">PPA</span>) with the <span class="smallcaps">U.S.</span> Department of Education to participate in Title <span class="smallcaps">IV</span> federal student financial aid programs are required to report data to <span class="smallcaps">IPEDS</span>, and are listed as separate entities in <span class="smallcaps">IPEDS</span>. These entities are considered the "main campus."</em></blockquote>
                    Additionally,
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>The <span class="smallcaps">IPEDS</span> definition of a branch campus is "a campus or site of an educational institution that is not temporary, is located in a community beyond a reasonable commuting distance from its parent institution, and offers full programs of study, not just courses."</em></li>
                        <li><em>The main campus and each additional location on the <span class="smallcaps">PPA</span> are listed separately in <span class="smallcaps">IPEDS</span>, and report their own data.</em></li>
                        <li><em>The main campus reports combined data for itself and any additional locations that are not listed separately in <span class="smallcaps">IPEDS</span>.</em></li>
                        <li><em>Additional locations that are not listed separately have the option of being made "campuses" in <span class="smallcaps">IPEDS</span>; a small number of data items are reported for each of these locations, and they are searchable in College Navigator.</em></li>
