            <h1>The Geography and Price of Higher Education Post-2008</h1>
            <p>Does the higher education system in the United States act like a typical market economy? As the costs continue to outpace incomes and student debt loads skyrocket, higher education is, de facto, no longer a public function. Institutional supply and student demand dictates the market’s behavior, with the federal government acting as lender to individual students, rather than state governments as public funders of institutions.</p>
            <p>The <span class="smallcaps">US</span> map below has been published in tandem with <a href="https://phenomenalworld.org/analysis/the-geography-and-cost-of-higher-education-post-2008">an in-depth analysis</a> on the changing geography of the <span class="smallcaps">US</span> higher education system. This map, as well as its accompanying study, explore the higher ed system at the zip code level from 2008 - 2017. Map data is delineated by year, college category, and driving distances. Using undergraduate enrollment and pricing data from <span class="smallcaps">IPEDS</span> and commuting distances around schools, researchers can show how prices interact with institutional concentration in the thousands of local higher education markets around the <span class="smallcaps">US</span>.</p>

            <h1>Summary Statistics</h1>
            <p>Local higher education markets are, in general, highly concentrated, and they have gotten more so over the last decade. For reference, an <span class="smallcaps">SCI</span> of 2500 implies there are four local institutions (assuming equal market share for each). 5000 implies two institutions with equal market share (i.e., half), and 10,000 means one institution.</p>
            <p>Over the last decade, the <span class="smallcaps">US</span> higher education system has become more concentrated. That has several causes: the decline of the for-profit sector after the Great Recession, alongside the expansion of traditional non-profit institutions to adopt a business model similar to that of the for-profits: many more, and higher-priced, debt-financed professional degrees, and accommodating existing programs to increase enrollment among nontraditional student populations. All of that has happened in the light of reduced state support for higher education and the expansion of the federal student loan system.</p>

            <h1>Methodology</h1>
            <p>The academic years represented here are from 2008 - 2009 to 2017 - 2018. For more information on the implications of the map and our preliminary findings, <a href="https://phenomenalworld.org/analysis/the-geography-and-cost-of-higher-education-post-2008">read our report here</a>. Below, find explanations of all variables. <a href="mailto:jfi@jainfamilyinstitute.org">Email us with questions about methods and findings here</a>.</p>
            <p>Variables derived for each <span class="smallcaps">ZCTA</span>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>School Concentration Index (<span class="smallcaps">SCI</span>)</b> - We modeled the calculation of the <span class="smallcaps">SCI</span> based on the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/atr/herfindahl-hirschman-index">Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (<span class="smallcaps">HHI</span>)</a>. The <span class="smallcaps">HHI</span> calculates market share for a particular company within a particular market; we calculate enrollment share for a particular school in a particular zip code tabulation area <span class="smallcaps">SCI</span> ranges from 0 (perfect competition) to 10,000 (complete monopoly). A <span class="smallcaps">SCI</span> of 10,000 indicates one school accounts for all the enrollment for that <span class="smallcaps">ZCTA</span>.
                    <p>$$ \text{SCI}_{\text{ZCTA}} = s_1^2 + s_2^2 + \dots + s_n^2 $$</p>
                    <div>Every <span class="smallcaps">ZCTA</span> has a unique School Concentration Index where $n$ number of schools in each <span class="smallcaps">SCI</span> equals the amount of schools where it is possible to drive to the associated <span class="smallcaps">ZCTA</span> within 30, 45, or 60 minutes, depending on the selected map view. Each $s_n$ is the undergraduate enrollment share of a school within the geographic area, expressed as a whole number rather than a fraction.</div>
                </li>
                <li><b>Number of Schools</b> - The number of schools displayed for each <span class="smallcaps">ZCTA</span> is a tally of the schools considered within a 30, 45, or 60 minute drive from at least a subsection of the <span class="smallcaps">ZCTA</span>. The <em>Number of schools</em> variable takes a whole number.</li>
                <li>
                    <b>Enrollment</b> - The enrollment displayed for each <span class="smallcaps">ZCTA</span> is the summation of the enrollment for every school considered within a 30, 45, or 60 minute drive from at least a subsection of the <span class="smallcaps">ZCTA</span>. <em>Enrollment</em> variable takes a whole number and is sourced from <span class="smallcaps">IPEDS</span> 12-Month Enrollment Table. This number indicates how many unduplicated undergraduate individuals enrolled for credit the institution served over a 12 month period, regardless of when the individual enrolled.
                    <p>$$ \text{Enrollment}_{\text{ZCTA}} = \text{enrollment}_1 + \text{enrollment}_2 + \dots + \text{enrollment}_n $$</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>25 Mile Zone Population Estimate</b> - In place of population estimates for individual <span class="smallcaps">ZCTA</span>, we list the summation of all the population estimates for the <span class="smallcaps">ZCTA</span>s within 25 miles of the selected area; the purpose being to complement the zone-type scale used for the <span class="smallcaps">SCI</span>. The 25 mile population zone originates from the mathematical centroid of each <span class="smallcaps">ZCTA</span>.
                    <p>$$ \text{Pop}_{\text{ZCTA-ZONE}} = \text{pop}_1 + \text{pop}_2 + \dots + \text{pop}_n $$</p>
                    <div>Every <span class="smallcaps">ZCTA</span> has a unique <em>25 Mile Zone Population Estimate</em> where $n$ number of <span class="smallcaps">ZCTA</span>s in each <span class="smallcaps">ZCTA</span>-zone equals the <span class="smallcaps">ZCTA</span>s accessible to the root <span class="smallcaps">ZCTA</span> within 25 miles. Each $\text{pop}_n$ is the population estimate for that specific <span class="smallcaps">ZCTA</span>. Both $\text{pop}_n$ and $\text{Pop}_{\text{ZCTA-ZONE}}$ take a whole number.</div>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Average Net Price</b> - <em>Average Net Price</em> is the average total cost of attending minus the average amount of federal, state or local government, or institutional grant and scholarship aid. Total cost of attendance is the sum of tuition, required fees, books and supplies, and the weighted average of room and board and other expenses. The value displayed for each <span class="smallcaps">ZCTA</span> is the mean of the average net price of each school considered within a 30, 45, or 60 minute drive from at least a subsection of the <span class="smallcaps">ZCTA</span>, weighted by the enrollment number of each school. The average net price per school is the average of the following variables sourced from <span class="smallcaps">IPEDS</span>: <span class="smallcaps">NPIS412</span>, <span class="smallcaps">NPIS422</span>, <span class="smallcaps">NPIS432</span>, <span class="smallcaps">NPIS442</span>, <span class="smallcaps">NPIS452</span>, <span class="smallcaps">NPT412</span>, <span class="smallcaps">NPT422</span>, <span class="smallcaps">NPT432</span>, <span class="smallcaps">NPT442</span>, <span class="smallcaps">NPT452</span>. These variables from <span class="smallcaps">IPEDS</span> show the average price of attendance for full-time, first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates paying the in-state or in-district tuition rate who were awarded title <span class="smallcaps">IV</span> federal student aid by varying degrees of student income level. All average net price values have been adjusted for inflation using the consumer price index (<span class="smallcaps">CPI</span>) deflator  and are in 2017 <span class="smallcaps">US</span> dollars.
                </li>

                        <li><em>For years 2011 - 2017</em>: Estimate; American Community Survey 5-year Estimates for the Median household income in the past 12 months (2017 inflation-adjusted dollars) of the <span class="smallcaps">ZCTA</span>. If a <span class="smallcaps">ZCTA</span> does not have a Median Income listed, this indicates that either no sample observations or too few sample observations were available to compute an estimate. Data are based on a sample and are subject to sampling variability. Median Income Estimates are not available for <span class="smallcaps">US</span> Territories besides Puerto Rico.</li>
                        <li><em>For 2009 and 2010</em>: Estimate; American Community Survey 5-year Estimates for the Median household income in the past 12 months (2017 inflation-adjusted dollars) of the <span class="smallcaps">US</span> Census tract. We then utilized the <a href="https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/usps_crosswalk.html"><span class="smallcaps">US</span> Department of Housing and Urban Development (<span class="smallcaps">HUD</span>) United States Postal Service <span class="smallcaps">ZIP</span> Code Crosswalk Files</a> (Tract to <span class="smallcaps">ZIP</span>) to estimate the Median Income of each <span class="smallcaps">ZCTA</span> by obtaining the weighted average of the product of the Census tract median income and the residential ratio for each <span class="smallcaps">ZIP</span> code associated with that Census tract.</span></li>
                        <li><em>For 2008</em>: Estimate; American Community Survey 3-year Estimates for the Median household income in the past 12 months (2017 inflation-adjusted dollars) of County. Utilized the <a href="https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/usps_crosswalk.html"><span class="smallcaps">US</span> Department of Housing and Urban Development (<span class="smallcaps">HUD</span>) United States Postal Service <span class="smallcaps">ZIP</span> Code Crosswalk Files</a> (<span class="smallcaps">ZIP</span> to County) to allocate the Median Income of each county to the respective <span class="smallcaps">ZCTA</span>’s that are within that county (calculated weighted average if a <span class="smallcaps">ZCTA</span> is in more than one county). In other words, for 2008, the Median Income variable indicates the median income of the county in which the <span class="smallcaps">ZCTA</span> is in if the county encompasses the entire <span class="smallcaps">ZCTA</span>; if the <span class="smallcaps">ZCTA</span> has residential addresses in multiple counties, the variable indicates the weighted average of the median income of the respective counties that encompass that <span class="smallcaps">ZCTA</span>.</li>

            <p>Exclusion Criteria:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We excluded schools that offered exclusively advanced degrees, exclusively distance learning degrees, and schools where <em>level</em> and <em>control</em> of institution were unknown. Also excluded were administrative offices of institutions when the institution itself was counted separately, as located. If a school offered a bachelors or higher degree but no degree below bachelors, the graduate to undergraduate student ratio was over 10, and the undergraduate enrollment was below 100, the school was excluded. For public schools, driving distances were restricted to the state where the school resides.</li>
                <li>In regards to branch campuses: <span class="smallcaps">IPEDS</span> does not require institutions to report data separately for branch campuses. Therefore <span class="smallcaps">JFI</span> researchers parsed through websites of over 400 colleges with high likelihoods of having branch campuses. If you suspect an error on our map or missing data, please do not hesitate to <a href="https://forms.gle/e5zztGTrBdHLRYex9">contact us</a>. More on how <span class="smallcaps">IPEDS</span> data is reported: According to the <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/statprog/handbook/pdf/ipeds.pdf">IPEDS handbook</a>,
                    <blockquote><em>All institutions in the <span class="smallcaps">U.S.</span> and other <span class="smallcaps">U.S.</span> jurisdictions that have a Program Participation Agreement (<span class="smallcaps">PPA</span>) with the <span class="smallcaps">U.S.</span> Department of Education to participate in Title <span class="smallcaps">IV</span> federal student financial aid programs are required to report data to <span class="smallcaps">IPEDS</span>, and are listed as separate entities in <span class="smallcaps">IPEDS</span>. These entities are considered the "main campus."</em></blockquote>
                    Additionally,
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>The <span class="smallcaps">IPEDS</span> definition of a branch campus is "a campus or site of an educational institution that is not temporary, is located in a community beyond a reasonable commuting distance from its parent institution, and offers full programs of study, not just courses."</em></li>
                        <li><em>The main campus and each additional location on the <span class="smallcaps">PPA</span> are listed separately in <span class="smallcaps">IPEDS</span>, and report their own data.</em></li>
                        <li><em>The main campus reports combined data for itself and any additional locations that are not listed separately in <span class="smallcaps">IPEDS</span>.</em></li>
                        <li><em>Additional locations that are not listed separately have the option of being made "campuses" in <span class="smallcaps">IPEDS</span>; a small number of data items are reported for each of these locations, and they are searchable in College Navigator.</em></li>

            <h1>About Our Sources</h1>
            <p>This analysis uses school-reported Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (<span class="smallcaps">IPEDS</span>) data from the final releases for the academic years of 2008-09 to 2017-18, and from the provisional release for the academic year 2018-19. For median income and population estimates, researchers used data from the American Community Survey. School isochrone creation for all driving distances was made using OpenStreetMap. Mapping abilities are possible because of MapBox and the <span class="smallcaps">US</span> Census Bureau’s 2018 <span class="smallcaps">TIGER</span>/Line Shapefiles. For institutions in the 2008-2009 years as well as all branch campuses, latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates were determined using Geocod.io. Median Income and Price data was adjusted to 2017 dollars using Federal Reserve Consumer Price Index data.</p>
