            <div class="release-date">This map was released in September 2020. To see the latest iteration and analysis check out the <a href="https://www.jainfamilyinstitute.org/projects/millennial-student-debt/">JFI Millennial Student Debt project page</a>. This project is a winner of Princeton University's 2020 Dignity + Debt <a href="https://www.dignityanddebt.org/projects/student-debt-contest/">Visualizing Student Debt Contest</a>. Updated February 2021 with <a href="./comparison">the comparisons page</a>.</div>
            <p>Student loan debt now stands at over $1.6 trillion according to <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/current/">estimates</a> released this month by the Federal Reserve, a 75% increase from 10 years ago. Since the Great Recession, both average balances and the number of borrowers have consistently increased across the board. As more borrowers accumulate more debt, they increasingly cannot pay it off. Student debt balances have the character of filling a bathtub in which the drain is blocked.</p>
            <p>This map and its <a href="https://phenomenalworld.org/analysis/millenial-student-debt">accompanying in-depth analysis</a> focus on the age group that is suffering the most from the student debt crisis—young adults aged 18–35. By examining the interaction between student loan balances, geography, income, and tuition, we seek to demystify the crisis and the year-over-year trends post-recession to 2019.

            <h1>About Our Sources</h1>
            <p>This analysis uses school-reported Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (<span class="smallcaps">IPEDS</span>) data from the final releases for the academic years of 2008–09 to 2017–18, and from the provisional release for the academic year 2018–2019. For median income and population estimates, we used data from the American Community Survey. For young-adult student debt balances, we used Experian’s consumer credit archives. School isochrone creation for all driving distances was made using OpenStreetMap. Mapping was done with MapBox and the <span class="smallcaps">US</span> Census Bureau’s 2018 <span class="smallcaps">TIGER</span>/Line Shapefiles. For institutions in the 2008–2009 years as well as all branch campuses, latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates were determined using Geocod.io. Median income, school prices, and debt values were adjusted to 2019 dollars using the Federal Reserve Consumer Price Index (all items) data.</p>

            <h1>Methodology</h1>
            <p>The academic years represented here are from 2008–2009 to 2018–2019. For more information on the implications of the map and our preliminary findings, read our report <a href="#TODO">here</a>. Below, find explanations of all variables.</p>
            <p>Variables derived for each <span class="smallcaps">ZCTA</span>:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>School Concentration Index (<span class="smallcaps">SCI</span>)</b> - We modeled the calculation of the <span class="smallcaps">SCI</span> based on the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/atr/herfindahl-hirschman-index">Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (<span class="smallcaps">HHI</span>)</a>. The <span class="smallcaps">HHI</span> calculates market share for a particular company within a particular market; we calculate enrollment share for a particular school in a particular zip code tabulation area. <span class="smallcaps">SCI</span> ranges from 0 (perfect competition) to 10,000 (complete monopoly). A <span class="smallcaps">SCI</span> of 10,000 indicates one school accounts for all the enrollment for that <span class="smallcaps">ZCTA</span>.
                    <p>$$ \text{SCI}_{\text{ZCTA}} = s_1^2 + s_2^2 + \dots + s_n^2 $$</p>
                    <div>Every <span class="smallcaps">ZCTA</span> has a unique School Concentration Index where \(n\) number of schools in each <span class="smallcaps">SCI</span> equals the amount of schools where it is possible to drive to the associated <span class="smallcaps">ZCTA</span> within 30, 45, or 60 minutes, depending on the selected map view. Each \(s_n\) is the undergraduate enrollment share of a school within the geographic area, expressed as a whole number rather than a fraction.</div>

The <em>Enrollment</em> variable takes a whole number and is sourced from <span class="smallcaps">IPEDS</span> 12-Month Enrollment Table.

                    <b>Average Net Price</b> - <em>Average Net Price</em> is the average total cost of attending minus the average amount of federal, state or local government, or institutional grant and scholarship aid. Total cost of attendance is the sum of tuition, required fees, books and supplies, and the weighted average of room and board and other expenses. The value displayed for each <span class="smallcaps">ZCTA</span> is the mean of the average net price of each school considered within a 30, 45, or 60 minute drive from at least a subsection of the <span class="smallcaps">ZCTA</span>, weighted by the enrollment number of each school.

All average net price values have been adjusted for inflation using the consumer price index (<span class="smallcaps">CPI</span>) deflator and are in 2019 <span class="smallcaps">US</span> dollars.

            <p>Exclusion Criteria:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We excluded schools that offered exclusively advanced degrees, exclusively distance learning degrees, and schools where <em>level</em> and <em>control</em> of institution were unknown. Also excluded were administrative offices of institutions when the institution itself was counted separately, as located. If a school offered a bachelors or higher degree but no degree below bachelors, the graduate to undergraduate student ratio was over 10, and the undergraduate enrollment was below 100, the school was excluded. For public schools, driving distances were restricted to the state where the school resides.</li>
                <li>In regards to branch campuses: <span class="smallcaps">IPEDS</span> does not require institutions to report data separately for branch campuses.
